Welcome to the EDLUT (Event-Driven Look-Up Table) project.
===============================================================

In this distribution of EDLUT you will find the next components:
- EDLUT source code into src and include folders.
- EDLUTKernel.cpp: This file is the main function of EDLUTKernel (an command-line interface to
EDLUT library).
- StepByStep.cpp: This file includes an example of how to include EDLUT simulator on your own
C/C++ system.
- NeuronModel folder: This folder includes the files that you need to compile the stochastic SRM
neuron model.
- NetUPMC.dat: This file defines the network topology.
- weightsInit.dat: This file defines the initial weights in the simulation.


How-to run your first simulation
================================

When you want to run your first simulation, you will have to complete the next steps:

1. Compile your cell models: This process is only necessary when you do not have the 
generated .dat file. If you are in the EDLUTIntegration folder, run:

$ cd NeuronModel
$ make
$ cp _romainSRMModified.* ../
$ cd ..

2. Compile the EDLUT Kernel executable:

$ make

3. Compile the StepByStep executable:

$ make -f makefileStep

4. After that, you may be able to run the StepByStep example executing:

$ ./bin/EDLUTStepByStep

or the EDLUTKernel with your own simulations executing:

$ ./bin/EDLUTKernel [a lot of parameters]

If you need more information about EDLUTKernel parameters, please read the README file included
in this folder.

The primary home page for this software can be found at http://edlut.googlecode.com. Here you
can find more information about this software, different versions, cell models, examples and the
last version of source code into the repository.

EDLUTKernel is developed on Linux/x86 and Windows (with Cygwin) using the GNU Compiler
Collection. Version 4.x of g++ is supported. 

Platform notes:
===============

For further information about the installation/compilation process,
please, see the INSTALL file.

Windows:
========
To compile EDLUT in Windows you may need Cygwin be installed with the develope tools
(g++, make, socket libraries...).

Linux:
======
To compile EDLUT in Linux you need the develope tools (g++, make, socket libraries...).

Additional Notes
================
The EDLUTKernel Library is still in a stage of heavy development.  At this
point in the project, the API is likely to change from version to version.
Most changes to existing interfaces will be small and easy to adjust for,
but there will occasionally be major changes to some areas.  Please report
any bugs by using the bug tracking system on the development home page.
Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
