=Development team=

The original EDLUT has been developed at the University of Granada (Dept. of Computer Architecture and Technology). The main developers are R. R. Carrillo, J. Garrido and E. Ros. The research coordination was performed by [http://atc.ugr.es/~eduardo/index.htm E. Ros]. 

Now the EDLUT has been released as Open Software facilitated by the [http://osl.ugr.es/ OSL] “Oficina de Software Libre” through the advice of [http://geneura.ugr.es/~jmerelo/ J.J. Merelo] of the University of Granada. This means that any other development effort can be done by any other member or the research community.
